Asthma Detection Dataset: Version 2
Overview
The Asthma Detection Dataset: Version 2 is a specialized collection of audio samples designed to facilitate research in diagnosing asthma and other lung conditions using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. This dataset is self-created and carefully curated, consisting of sound files segmented into 1.5-5 seconds to ensure consistency and manageability for analysis. The dataset is ideal for developing and testing ML models aimed at detecting asthma through the analysis of lung sounds.
Dataset Composition
The dataset comprises a total of 1,211 audio samples, divided into five distinct classes representing various lung conditions:
•	Asthma: 288 samples
•	Bronchial: 104 samples
•	COPD: 401 samples
•	Healthy: 133 samples
•	Pneumonia: 255 samples
Each folder in the dataset corresponds to one of these classes, containing audio recordings specific to that condition. The distribution of samples is balanced to allow effective training and evaluation of ML models.
Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset was generated by processing and splitting recordings from two standard audio datasets, as well as additional recordings from individual patients. Each recording was divided into smaller segments, each lasting between 1.5-5 seconds, to standardize the input data for ML models. The data were collected from the following sources:
1.	The Respiratory Sound Database: Approximately 170 samples were obtained from this database and preprocessed to remove noise and segment into 5-6 second intervals. The original database can be accessed at DOI: 10.1016/j.bbe.2020.11.003.
2.	ICBHI (International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics) Dataset: 212 samples were sourced from this dataset, known for its comprehensive collection of respiratory sounds. These were also preprocessed and segmented. The dataset is available at PhysioNet ICBHI dataset.
3.	Additional Samples from 22 Patients: The remaining samples were collected from 18 individual patients, including both normal (healthy) individuals and those diagnosed with various respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and pneumonia.
The following preprocessing steps were applied:
•	Data Cleaning: Noise reduction and cleaning were performed using WavePad software to enhance the clarity of the lung sounds. Irrelevant, incomplete, or noisy entries were removed.
•	Amplification: The volume of the recordings was adjusted using the amplify function in WavePad to ensure consistent loudness across all samples.
•	Segmentation: Audio files were segmented to ensure uniformity in duration, facilitating consistent analysis. All audio files were standardized to 5-6 seconds in length.
Applications
This dataset is suitable for a wide range of research applications, including but not limited to:
•	Developing ML and DL models for the diagnosis of asthma and other lung conditions.
•	Comparative studies on the efficacy of different classification algorithms in identifying lung conditions from audio data.
•	Exploratory analysis to understand the unique acoustic patterns associated with different lung diseases.
